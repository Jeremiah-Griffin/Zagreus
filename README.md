# Zagreus
Both a reference to the rebirth of minor greek deity and the rogue-ness of the videogame he protaganizes, Zagreus is a featureful library
for backoffs in use at [Ceres](www.ceres.us) and in some of my personal projects.

The first version will be published very soon but for the moment this repo is just a stub.
