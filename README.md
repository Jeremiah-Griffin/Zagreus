# Zagreus
Both a reference to the rebirth of minor greek deity and the rogue-ness of the videogame he protaganizes, Zagreus is a featureful library
for backoffs in use at [Ceres](www.ceres.us) and in some of my personal projects.

The first version will be published very soon but for the moment this repo is just a stub.

# Features:
- Asynchronous API
- Short circuiting on errors that are unrecoverable
- Interval randomization
- Error and interval interception

# Usage:

There are three traits with which users of this crate must familiarize themselves:
`BackoffStrategy`: Defines the algorithm used to create backoff intervals.
`Randomizer`: Adds randomization to intervals generated by the BackoffStrategy. 
`BackoffHandler`: Generates (and sleeps for) the amount of time produced by the BackoffStrategy as randomized by the Randomizer.

Start by creating a BackoffStrategy. This is very simple and involves only defining a `limit()` to the number of attempts iterations
and an `interval()` method to calculate the time between said iterations.

Then, create a `Randomizer`. Use the library, bounds, and source of randomness of your choosing: implementors
need only expose the `randomize` method, which takes an un-randomized Duration and returns a new one with the desired variance.

Additionally, you may find it useful to override the default implementation of `BackoffHandler::log()` to hook your logging infrastructure into the Retry loop.

While the API surface is large for what it is, this crate is intended to be used as a building block to cover the majority of behavior one may desire
in a retrying implementation. To wrangle this complexity it is recommended to hide implementors of BackoffHandler within another (new)type which
has the parameters for `handle()` predefined and stored within itself for each given usecase. 

# FAQ:

Q: How do I cap the amount of time that can be used by retries?

A: Return `None` from `BackoffStrategy::interval()`.
There are too many distinct ways to track time than would be sound for this crate to opine upon. Instead, implementors of BackoffStrategy
may track the time from the first call to interval to the final, and return None when this value exceeds the maximum interval.

While this api makes any cost associated with timing requests opt-in, it makes cancelling in-flight requests that exceed the time alotted
by the Strategy impossible.

Cancelling in-flight requests is outside the scope of this library and should be handled elsewhere.
